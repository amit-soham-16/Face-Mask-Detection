# Face Mask Detection

This repository contains a **Face Mask Detection** project implemented in **Python** using **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and **Machine Learning**. The project is designed to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks in real-time, promoting adherence to public health guidelines.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**
  - Detect face masks through live webcam feeds.

- **High Accuracy**
  - Optimized deep learning models to achieve over 70% detection accuracy.

- **Multi-Class Detection**
  - Identify individuals with or without face masks.

- **User-Friendly Implementation**
  - Easy-to-run scripts with detailed instructions.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning**: Deep Learning models for image classification

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amit-soham-16/Face-Mask-Detection.git
   cd Face-Mask-Detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Pretrained Models**
   - Ensure you have access to the pretrained face mask detection model.
   - Place the model file in the appropriate directory (e.g., `models/`).

4. **Run the Application**
   Execute the script to start real-time mask detection:
   ```bash
   python face_mask_detection.py
   ```
